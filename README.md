## Directories
### 00 Utility Scripts
These are scripts we wrote to help auotmate tasks, e.g. reorganizing the dataset to serve a specific training task.

### 01 Camera Matrix Info
The provided information about the camera intrinsic and extrinsic matrices, used in the 'Geometric Scene Reconstruction' portion of our experiments.

### 02 Notebooks
Various notebooks from the course of working on the project.  They are pre-run, which should make them straightforward to follow.  They provide organized, sequential workflows for experiments that we conducted, including source code, pre-rendered graphs, plots and graphics.

### 03 Experiments
Source code for model training for experiments that we performed.  We have only included experiments that we consider to be significant in our overall efforts.

### 04 Competition Scripts
Scripts specific to the competition submission for the DS-GA 1008 competition.

## Other Scripts In This Repository
The source code for the Conditional GAN that we designed and implemented for generating Road and Object maps.  Our hope is that the source code should be readable and self-explanatory.
