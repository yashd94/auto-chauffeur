# NYU Deep Learning Spring 2020 Final Project
**Techniques and ideas explored in this project:**
- Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
- Pretext-Invariant Representation Learning
- Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Prediction
- Geometric Scene Reconstruction.

## Directories
### 00 Utility Scripts
These are scripts written by our team to help auotmate tasks, e.g. reorganizing the dataset to serve a specific training task.

### 01 Camera Matrix Info
Provided information about the camera intrinsic and extrinsic matrices, used in the 'Geometric Scene Reconstruction' portion of our experiments.

### 02 Notebooks
These are organized notebooks from the course of working on the project.  They are pre-run, which should make them clear and easy to digest and get insight into our working process.  In these notebooks, you will find organized, sequential workflows for experiments that we conducted, including source code, pre-rendered graphs, plots and graphics.

### 03 Experiments
Source code for model training for experiments that we performed.  The experiments that we included have survived a pruning process (we did not include any experiments that were only partially implemented or that we did not invest substantial effort to train.)

### 04 Competition Scripts
Scripts specific to the competition submission for the DS-GA 1008 competition.

## Other Scripts In This Repository
The source code for the Conditional GAN that we designed and implemented for generating Road and Object maps.  Our hope is that the source code should be readable and self-explanatory.
